# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the project
The purpose of this project was to evaluate three machine learning models by using resampling to determine which is better at predicting credit risk. First,  the oversampling RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms were used, and then the undersampling ClusterCentroids algorithm was used. Using  these algorithms, the dataset was resampled, the count of the target classes was viewed,  a logistic regression classifier was trained, the balanced accuracy score was calculated, a confusion matrix was generated, and  a classification report was created.
